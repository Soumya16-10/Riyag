        <p>Dear Riya Maâ€™am,<br>
            Thank you sooo much for helping me with Science and Maths!
            You make learning fun and explain everything like magic!
            You always listen to me, ask me sweet questions, and cheer me up when I feel confused.
            You donâ€™t just teach me subjectsâ€”you teach me how to believe in myself too!
            Youâ€™re like a teacher, a friend, and a life guide all in one!
            Big hugs and a giant thank-you from your little student! ðŸ˜Š

        <p>Dear Riya Maâ€™am,<br>
            Even though you scold me sometimes (okay, maybe a lot ðŸ˜…), youâ€™re still my absolute favorite!
            You never make me feel just like a studentâ€”you make me feel like a friend too.
            I secretly love how you care so much and always want the best for me.
            You even share your life stories and little lessons that really stay with me.
            Thank you for being more than a teacherâ€”youâ€™re like a cool guide and my cheerleader too!
            Lots of love (and a tiny complaint for all the scoldings ).

        <p>Dear Riya Maâ€™am,<br>
            I really love coming to tuition because it feels so nice and happy!
            You are always smiling and kind, and that makes me feel safe and smart.
            You never shout, you just help me understand everything slowly.
            Studying with you is like having fun with a smart friend!
            Thank you for making my study hours the happiest part of my day!<br>
            Love,<br>
            Your little student ðŸ˜Š
